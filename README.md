# electron-app

This is my first app desktop using electronJs

To run this project in your machine 

``` bash
npm install
```
or

```bash
npm i
```

You need to make this project a executable in your machine, for this use this command bellow:

```bash
npm run build
```

Now you can run like a executable.
